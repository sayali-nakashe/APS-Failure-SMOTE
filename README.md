# APS-Failure-SMOTE
Analysis of Tree based methods on APS failure dataset using SMOTE

In this project , I have studied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and trained a Logistic Model Tree using the
pre-processed data for classification of data on the APS Failure dataset.

The dataset used is  APS Failure dataset from : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/APS+Failure+at+Scania+Trucks. 

The dataset contains a training set and a test set. The training set contains 60,000 rows, of which 1,000 belong to the positive class and 171 columns, of which one is the class column. All attributes are numeric.

The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the  Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The datasets' positive class consists of component failures  for a specific component of the APS system. 
The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS. The data consists of a subset of all available data, selected by experts.
